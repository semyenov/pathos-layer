# Organization Management

The project includes a multi-organization system where users can belong to multiple organizations with different roles.

## Key Concepts

- **Organizations**: Top-level entities that group users and resources
- **Members**: Users within organizations with specific roles
- **Roles**: Different permission levels within organizations

## Member Roles

- `owner` - Full control over the organization
- `reviewer` - Can review forms and approve changes
- `executor` - Can create and edit forms
- `member` - Basic access to view forms

## GraphQL Operations

Organization operations are defined in:

- [server/graphql/types/organization.ts](mdc:server/graphql/types/organization.ts) - Organization operations
- [server/graphql/types/member.ts](mdc:server/graphql/types/member.ts) - Member operations
- [server/graphql/types/session.ts](mdc:server/graphql/types/session.ts) - Active organization selection

## Multi-organization Context

Users can belong to multiple organizations but have one active organization at a time, which is stored in their session.
