# Form System

The project includes a comprehensive form management system with templates, fields, and review workflows.

## Key Concepts

- **Templates**: Form templates that define the structure of forms
- **Forms**: Instances created from templates that can be filled and submitted
- **Fields**: Form fields with various types (text, number, date, select, etc.)
- **Review Flows**: Workflows for reviewing and approving forms

## Database Structure

- Templates → Template Fields
- Forms → Form Fields
- Review Flows → Comments

## GraphQL Operations

Form operations are defined in:

- [server/graphql/types/template.ts](mdc:server/graphql/types/template.ts) - Template and form operations
- [server/graphql/types/reviewFlow.ts](mdc:server/graphql/types/reviewFlow.ts) - Review flow operations
- [server/graphql/types/comment.ts](mdc:server/graphql/types/comment.ts) - Comment operations

## Form Statuses

Forms progress through several statuses:
- `draft` - Initial creation
- `underReview` - Submitted for review
- `needsChanges` - Requires modifications
- `approved` - Fully approved
- `rejected` - Rejected
